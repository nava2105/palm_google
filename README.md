## General Information
***
This project is a **Python-based PDF Management System** that allows users to:
- Upload and process PDF files to extract metadata and content.
- Generate embeddings using **Google Generative AI** to identify specific document details such as provider, RUC, awarded value, and administrative details for "Adjudications Resolution". For "Start Resolution", it extracts committee member details.
- Interact with a **GUI-based application (Tkinter)** to manage documents visually.
- Save and edit JSON data generated by AI and store it in organized folders.

The system uses advanced AI technologies for preprocessing texts (e.g., extraction and splitting chunks) and semantic analysis using embeddings.

## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
- [Python](https://www.python.org): Version 3.12.0
- [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): For PDF text extraction.
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/): For extracting metadata from PDF files.
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/): For splitting text into manageable chunks.
- [Google Generative AI (`Gemini`)](https://ai.google.dev/): For advanced text embeddings and generative responses.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): To calculate cosine similarity between embeddings.
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): For creating the graphical user interface.

## Installation
***
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.12.0 installed by verifying with:
```bash
python --version
```

### Install the Project

#### Clone the Repository
Download the project files from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nava2105/palm_google.git
cd palm_google
```

#### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Activate on Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate on macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install Required Dependencies
Install all the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API key:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### Run the Application
After setup, run the main application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
***
### Key Features
1. **Upload Files:**
   - Upload PDF files directly into the application.
2. **Extract and Display Metadata:**
   - Display extracted PDF metadata and AI-processed results for embedded content.
3. **Save JSON Data:**
   - Save extracted details in JSON files in designated folders.
4. **Edit Extracted JSON Data:**
   - Directly edit and save data within the GUI.
5. **Download Files:**
   - Download uploaded PDFs to your local system.
6. **Search and Filter:**
   - Easily search and display specific files from the uploaded list.

### How to Use
1. **Upload a PDF File:**
   - Use the **Upload File** button to select and upload a PDF file via the GUI.
2. **Process the File:**
   - After selecting the uploaded file, click on **Details** to extract and display processed metadata.
3. **Save JSON Data:**
   - Use the **Save JSON** button to store the results into either `results_adjudication` or `results_start` folders.
4. **Edit JSON Data:**
   - Use the **Edit JSON** feature to make manual adjustments to the JSON output directly from the application.
5. **Download Files:**
   - Using the **Download File** button, retrieve and save the uploaded file locally.

### Output
- Extracted file details are saved as JSON files in the `results_adjudication` or `results_start` folders, depending on the selected document type.
- Uploaded files are stored in their respective folders (`uploads_adjudication` or `uploads_start`) for convenient reference.
- Errors or logs are displayed in the console for debugging purposes.

## Notes
***
- **Disclaimer:** This project utilizes the **Google Generative AI API**. Ensure you have a valid API key and proper billing set up in your Google account.
- Required folders such as `uploads_*` and `results_*` are created automatically if they do not already exist when launching the project.

## Additional Information
The application provides a robust system to manage PDF documents with a focus on extracting relevant information efficiently using AI. The GUI ensures user-friendliness, while features like JSON editing and filtering enhance its usability.
